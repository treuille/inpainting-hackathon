# Adrien's Inpainting Project

## Streamlit May Hackathon 

This project is broken into three branche:

1. `master`: This is a basic inpainting Streamlit app.
2. `cc-inpainting`: This uses custom components to let the user draw a mask.
3. `s4a-deploy`: Designed to be deployed in Streamlit for All. This didn't work because of some problems with OpenCV.

**Important Note:** Each of these branches has their own, incomptabile `Pipfile`, so take care that you uninstall, delete, and re-install the pipenv when changing branches.
